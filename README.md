# How to run

Clone the repo with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/MetOs-UiO/fates_platform_ecological_climatology --config core.autocrlf=input`

Then run the following from the project root:

`docker-compose up`

After you see a message containing `Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)` in `api` docker logs, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs` and the UI at `http://localhost:8080`.

You can access the Jupyter server at `http://localhost:8888/lab`.

> ## Note:
>
> If you are on Linux, you can run the following command to set the user and id in in a `.env` in the project root:
>
> ```echo "HOST_USER=$(whoami)\nHOST_UID=$(id -u)\nHOST_GID=$(id -g)" > .env```
>
> Doing this makes all the new files and folders created by the app to belong to your local user. Otherwise, all new objects will be owned by the `root` user.
