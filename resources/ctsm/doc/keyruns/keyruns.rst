    **Left column (from top to bottom):** Globally and annually averaged Net radiation @ top of model, Surface (2m) air temperature, Sea surface temperature (SST), global and volume averaged ocean temperature, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) @ 26.5N. **Right column (from top to bottom):** Globally and annually sum of Sea salt surface emissions, DMS (dimethylsulfide) surface emissions, globally and annually averaged vertically-integrated total cloud cover, shortwave cloud forcing and longwave cloud forcing.
