One-line Summary: Change compset in test

In an upcoming CTSM tag, the compset I2000Clm50BgcCropRtmGs will be
renamed to I2000Clm50BgcCropRtm (while keeping the same meaning as
before). This tag changes a test to use the new alias, to keep RTM
compatible with this upcoming CTSM tag.

Note that this change will require the upcoming CTSM tag (probably
ctsm5.1.dev011) in order to run this test from the rtm test list.

One-line Summary: some nuopc updates

Some nuopc updates from @mvertens. New directory nuopc_cap_share. 
SetVM is made public in rof_comp_nuopc.F90. ROF is used in rtmIO
rather than instance name.

These changes are almost identical to the latest nuopc changes 
for mosart, but not quite the same.

Also add nuopc_cap_share to the Filepath for the build.
"*txt*" files are no longer copied to the $RUNDIR.

One-line Summary: Add NUOPC cap

This tag brings in the necessary changes to rtm to have a new NUOPC cap
introduced.

Most changes are from Mariana Vertenstein, brought to master by Bill
Sacks.

These changes are documented in https://github.com/ESCOMP/RTM/pull/20

Testing: rtm test suite (cheyenne & izumi), in the context of a CTSM
checkout (https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/pull/939). Baseline comparisons
done against ctsm1.0.dev085.

One-line Summary: Fix cold-starts and remove mosart from files

You couldn't set finidat_rtm to blank to indicate a cold start should
be done. This fixes that issue. It now both indicates that a cold start
should happen, AND it doesn't search for an empty filename from inputdata.

Also added a cold-start test to make sure this continues to work.

mosart was in a few places and it was changed to refer to "rtm" now.
For example the list of files needed was mosart.input_data_files now
it's properly rtm.input_data_files.

Fixes: #14, #15

   Fixes #14 -- Can't set finidat_rtm to blank indicating a cold-start
   Fixes #15 -- mosart is used in the title of some files

One-line Summary: Move release-cesm2.0.02 to master

basetype wasn't declared and needed to be. Also add more "implicit none"
statements in. Remove the deletion of "rtm.input_data_list" file, as cime
now does this. Remove the option of setting single-precision
history output, as it sometimes has numerical conversion issues. The
real solution for it should be to keep a single-precision history
buffer that then outputs at the same precision as stored, rather than
converting just before. This would trigger issues with the conversion
earlier.

Changes ported from mosart/#15 to rtm. Run pylint through buildlib/buildnml,
changes for fill value needed for pio2. Also use the floor operator
for a specific integer divide as python3 turns it into reals.

Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

One-line Summary: Treat irrigation specially, tweak volr

(1) Together with corresponding cime and clm changes, treats irrigation as a
    separate flux. The point of this is to map irrigation withdrawals normalized
    by volr, to help prevent river channels from going to negative volumes.

(2) Tweaks the volr field sent to the coupler. Sean Swenson expected this to
    have an effect, although it appears not to, at least from the rtm and
    aux_clm45 test suite.

Requires the cime changes from https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/pull/681

In order for the new irrigation changes to have an effect, also requires the CLM
changes from the branch
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branches/limitirrig - although this
code will work correctly without the CLM changes (in this case, irrigation will
simply be 0, and the irrigation flux will be folded in to a different runoff
flux).

Changes are from Sean Swenson; reviewed, tested and brought to the trunk by Bill
Sacks.

Testing: rtm test suite (on yellowstone), from
https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/clm2/branch_tags/limitirrig_tags/limitirrig_n10_clm4_5_12_r196

All tests passed and were bit-for-bit with testing from clm4_5_12_r196 with cime
at d321e4b (the baseline for the relevant cime branch).

Also ran aux_clm45 test suite; most tests passed; I'm looking into remaining
failures and will update rtm if it turns out it was the source of any problems.

  The namelist variable, rtm_effvel is now preset to ACTIVE and effvel_active is set to 
  true.  This forces rtm to use slope in the velocity calculation.  If a user wants
  backward compatibilty with clm4_0_* tags, rtm_effvel will have to be set to NULL.

One-line Summary:  Add effVel as namelist.  cleanup RtmFloodInit logic

	- Add effective velocity as a namelist variable.
	- Change rdirc file.
	- Add RTM tests to test_system batch CLM tests.
	- Clean up logic in RtmFloodInit so R01 works without SLOPE and MAX_VOLR.
	- The modification to effvel (for the default case) changes the amount
	    of runoff (r2x_Forr_roff & r2x_Forr_ioff) in the system and does change climate.
	    The value is what is in CLM4.5
   - Change rdirc file to rdirc_0.5x0.5_simyr2000_slpmxvl_c120717.nc which is
	    correct and contains FLOOD and MAX_VOLR.  This fixes an error in choice
