For info about the "In-situ Particle Number Size 
Distribution (PNSD) Measurement Comparison", see

The first scripts are used to convert monthly model 
output to usable input to the PNSD fortran code, and 
are to be run in the following order (e.g. on the 
norstore cruncher):

1. make-12mnth-climatotlogy.sh
2. take-out-surface-fields.sh

Then some fortan code must be used to create the 
global aerocom3-INSITU-PNSD output (this program, 
pnsd, can be run from your home directory at hexagon):

3. pnsd

Finally use these ncl scripts (from Kai Zhang, see
https://github.com/kaizhangpnl/sample_insitu, slightly 
modified) to create nc file with lat-lon station info
(latlon.nc), and produce size distribution data for 
each station (these scripts can easily be run on local 
machine, e.g. with symbolical links to the input files 
from pnsd):

4. create_latlon.ncl
5. sample.ncl

Input to 4 is st.dat, lat.dat and lon.dat. The script
sample.ncl must be edited for choice of type of size 
distribution field. Available so far: dndlogdaer, 
dmdlogdss and dmdlogddust, where the latter two 
are just approximations (see pnsd.f for more info).
