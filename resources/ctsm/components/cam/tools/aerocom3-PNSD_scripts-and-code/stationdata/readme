Required software: NCL (http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/) 

create_latlon.ncl : create latlon information file latlon.nc 

sample.ncl : sample grid-box mean model data at given lat/lon 
             all variables in the history file will be sampled at given locations 

             the output variables will have dimensions like [time, station_index] or [time, lev, station_index] 

             the station index is put into the rightest dimension so that we can use CDO (https://code.zmaw.de/projects/cdo) to process the data (e.g. temporal averaging).
