ISSUES REMAINING:

NEEDED BEFORE PRODUCT IS FINISHED
********************************************

*) Include config-files for aerocom emissions

*) Create historical, RCP60 and RCP85 for all fields BC/OC/SO2 (finish ipccConfig.xml)

*) Allow reading of old ascii files. SOA.1x1 , check readpom.f under aerocomemis.
The files aerocom.soxbb.fv19.asciiflat go into the cam program. Do this on netcdf format.

*) Allow input-file for hight-scaling of emissions. Do this outside of program. All input-files must be 
   on right grid when input to this program. Explain in manual how to do this.

*) Correct OH in stratosphere. This is only special files which contain OH-concentration


NICE TO DO / IMPROVEMENTS
********************************************

*) Same point as above, but for transforming yearly data to monthly data. Possibly this should also go 
   outside program in stand-alone script.

*) Allow scale-factor per sector to increase or increase sector emissions

*) Speed up initial scanning of possible output files (this command is for example REALLY slow: python main.py -x ipccConfig.xml -s RCP85)

*) Code clean up

*) Create xml schema validator to validate configuration files (allowed sectors, allowed conversions etc)
