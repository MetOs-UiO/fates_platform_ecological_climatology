       batch_query:      the batch query command for each batch system.
       batch_redirect:   Whether a redirect character is needed to submit jobs.
       batch_directive:  The string that prepends a batch directive for the batch system.

   ===============================================================
   batch_system
   ===============================================================
   The batch_system and associated tags are meant for configuring batch systems and
   queues across machines.  The batch_system tag denotes the name for a particular
   batch system, these can either be shared between one or more machines, or can be
   defined for a specific machine if need be.

   Machine specific entries take precidence over generic entries, directives are appended

   queues:
   one or more queues can be defined per batch_system. if the attribute default="true"
   is used, then that queue will be used by default. Alternatively, multiple queues can
   be used.  The following variables can be used to choose a queue :
   walltimemin: Giving the minimum amount of walltime for the queue.
   walltimemax: The maximum amount of walltime for a queue.
   nodemin:      The minimum node count required to use this queue.
   nodemax:      The maximum node count required to use this queue.
   jobmin:      The minimum task count required to use this queue. This should only rarely be used to select queues that only use a fraction of a node. This cannot be used in conjuction with nodemin.
   jobmax:      The maximum task count required to use this queue. This should only rarely be used to select queues that only use a fraction of a node. This cannot be used in conjuction with nodemax.
